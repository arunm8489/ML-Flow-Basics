MLFlow-Projects
---------------
An MLflow Project is a format for packaging data science code in a reusable and reproducible way.
usecase:
Suppose other datascientist/MLengineer need to rerun our experiment.In that case we can provide the entire code and 
requirements for recreate experiments in form of MLProjects.

Here we encapsulate every code, data and parameters in MLProject file so that the experiment can be recreated.
Note: For that create a MyProject.yaml file with conda path along with parameters, train and validation code path and command to execute those.

MLProject file: 
* name: name of the project 
* entry_points: Commands that can be run within the project, and information about their parameters. 
Most projects contain at least one entry point that you want other users to call. Some projects can also contain more than one entry point:
for example, we might have a single Git repository containing multiple featurization algorithms. We can also call any .py or .sh file in the project as an entry point.
* environment: conda/docker environmnts for project execution.

May contains following files:
Need following components:

* MLProject.yaml 
* conda.yaml  (environment)
* train.py  
* validate.py (if present)



# mlflow run -P n_estimators=300 -P max_depth=7 -P exp_name="final"
